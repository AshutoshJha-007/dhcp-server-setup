## 1️⃣ Ethernet and IP Configuration Issues

### 🔹 **Problem 1: Ethernet Connection Not Working**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Ensure the **Ethernet cable is properly plugged** into both the workstation and switch/router.
- Run the following command to check if the **network interface card (NIC) is detected**:
  ```bash
  ip link show
  ```
- Restart the network service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart networking
  ```
- Check if the interface is assigned an IP:
  ```bash
  ip addr show eth0
  ```

### 🔹 **Problem 2: IP Address Conflict**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Identify conflicting devices:
  ```bash
  arp -a
  ```
- Release and renew the IP:
  ```bash
  sudo dhclient -r eth0
  sudo dhclient eth0
  ```
- Assign a **static IP** for critical systems.

### 🔹 **Problem 3: DHCP Not Assigning IP Address**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Check if DHCP is enabled on the workstation:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/network/interfaces | grep dhcp
  ```
- Restart the DHCP client:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-client
  ```

## 2️⃣ Printer Malfunctions

### 🔹 **Problem 1: Printer Not Responding**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Check if the printer is online:
  ```bash
  lpstat -p
  ```
- Restart the print spooler service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart cups
  ```

### 🔹 **Problem 2: Paper Jam or Hardware Issues**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Open the printer cover and remove any jammed paper.
- Run the built-in printer diagnostic tool.

## 3️⃣ Software/Hardware Integration Issues

### 🔹 **Problem 1: External Device Not Recognized**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Check if the device is detected:
  ```bash
  lsusb
  lspci
  ```
- Reinstall device drivers.

### 🔹 **Problem 2: Software Installation Fails**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Check system compatibility:
  ```bash
  uname -a
  ```
- Reinstall dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -f
  ```

---

## 4️⃣ Network Connectivity Issues

### 🔹 **Problem 1: No Internet Access**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Check network configuration:
  ```bash
  ip route show
  ```
- Restart network services:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart networking
  ```

### 🔹 **Problem 2: Slow Internet Speed**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Test speed using:
  ```bash
  speedtest-cli
  ```
- Reduce background processes consuming bandwidth.

### 🔹 **Problem 3: Wi-Fi Dropping Frequently**
#### ✅ Solution:
- Switch to a less crowded Wi-Fi channel.
- Update the Wi-Fi adapter firmware.

## 6️⃣ Advanced Troubleshooting Techniques

### 🔹 **Network Packet Analysis with tcpdump**
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n
```

### 🔹 **Checking Active Network Connections**
```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

### 🔹 **Diagnosing Firewall Issues**
```bash
sudo iptables -L -v -n
```
